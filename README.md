# pop_pyramid
This repository is a project that allows the user to view gendered population pyramids from the half-year population counts of countries across the world. Included in the csv folder are the individual country csv data sheets. The module will prompt the user to enter a string value based on the csv file names which are based on their country. 

The user must download the csv.zip file, and extract the archived csv folder to the same location as the python file.
